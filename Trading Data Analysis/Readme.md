2. Data Handling & Exploration
2.1 Data Cleaning Steps

Handling Missing & Duplicate Values: Checked for missing and duplicate values. None found.
Column Standardization: Renamed columns with spaces to underscore format

Example: take profit â†’ take_profit


Whitespaces: Removed leading and trailing whitespaces from string values.
DateTime Conversion: Converted time columns (e.g., open_time, close_time) to proper datetime format.
Numeric Validation: Created a list of columns that contains crucial financial data and converted them into numeric floating point numbers to handle NaN, inconsistent, and non-numeric values.

2.2 Data Wrangling Steps

Profitable Flag: Binary indicator (1 for profit, 0 otherwise)
Price Change: Absolute difference between close_price and open_price
Pips per Volume: Efficiency metric with 1e-6 added to prevent division by zero
Trade Duration: Calculated in both seconds and hours
